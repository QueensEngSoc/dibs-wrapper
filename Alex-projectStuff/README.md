# dibs-wrapper

Figured I should probably move my project from the testing branch to master so people could play around with it.  Any future development (aka creation of random but fun features) on this particular fork will most likely continue on the testing branch for now, since the project is most likely moving forward with a different set of underlying frameworks (Mustache instead of Jade).  

This particular build has initial MongoDB database support, full Dibs room booking capabilities (currently disabled) basic room time picking, up to date room status and a dynamic page generation from the backend.  It's also incredibly messy though, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
